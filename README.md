# Implementation-of-Seq2Seq-Model
The aim of this project is to implement the Seq2Seq Model on IMDB movie review dataset.
The provided code implements a Seq2Seq (Sequence-to-Sequence) model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers on the IMDB movie review dataset. The goal of this Seq2Seq model is to generate text sequences, particularly movie reviews, by taking in an input sequence and generating an output sequence of the same length.
Importing Libraries: The necessary libraries are imported, including numpy, tensorflow.keras, and matplotlib.
Importing Dataset: The IMDB movie review dataset is downloaded and loaded using tf.keras.utils.get_file and numpy. The dataset is stored in a NumPy array format. The training data (X_train) contains sequences of movie reviews, and the corresponding labels (y_train) indicate whether each review is positive or negative.
Padding the Input and Target Sequences: The input sequences (movie reviews) in both the training and testing sets are padded using pad_sequences. This ensures that all sequences have the same length for modeling purposes.
Defining the Seq2Seq Model Architecture:
Encoder: The encoder part of the Seq2Seq model takes the input sequences and processes them to produce a fixed-size context vector that represents the input sequence's information. It consists of an Embedding layer, followed by an LSTM layer with latent_dim units (256 units in this case). The LSTM layer is set to return the LSTM cell's final hidden state (state_h) and the final cell state (state_c) as the encoder outputs. The state_h and state_c will be used as initial states for the decoder.
Decoder: The decoder part takes the encoder outputs and generates the output sequences. It also uses an Embedding layer followed by an LSTM layer with latent_dim units. The decoder LSTM is set to return the full sequences, which means it produces a sequence of words step-by-step.
Decoder Dense Layer: A Dense layer with num_words units and a softmax activation function is used to predict the probabilities of the next words in the sequence.
Create and Compile the Model: The Seq2Seq model is created using the Model class from Keras, with the encoder and decoder inputs and the decoder outputs. It is then compiled with the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function. The model's performance will be evaluated using accuracy as the metric.
Training the Model: The model is trained using the fit function. It takes the training data, the target sequences (in this case, the same as the input sequences for teacher forcing during training), batch size, and the number of epochs. The validation data is provided as well to monitor the model's performance on unseen data during training. The training progress is saved in the history variable for plotting later.
Visualize the Accuracy and Loss: The code plots the training and validation accuracy and loss using matplotlib. The plots provide insights into the model's training progress and potential overfitting or underfitting issues.
The model is trained on the IMDB movie review dataset using a Seq2Seq architecture with LSTM layers, and the results of the training process are visualized to monitor the model's performance.
